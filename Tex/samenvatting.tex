Every year the Flemisch Institute for the sea organises a shell counting day to map the diversity of our seaside. 
Thousands of volunteers go to the beach to count and classify shells. 
In this thesis we will try to automate this process by using neural networks.
The goal is to be able to count the shells in an uncontrolled environment so the volunteers would only have to take pictures of the shells and the neural network would do the rest.

Of course this is not a trivial task, as the shells are not always in the same position, 
the lighting conditions are not always the same and the shells are not always of the same size.
