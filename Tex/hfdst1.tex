\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
In this section we'll talk about the background of the problem we're trying to solve. 
We'll talk about the way things are done currently and why we think improvements can be made.

\section{Methods}
Here we'll about the methods of counting that are used and how they could be applied to our problem.
Taking into account the absense of a dataset, we'll narrow the options down to few-shot learning.

\section{Objectives}
In this section we'll talk more about the goals.
We'll talk about the dataset we'll be testing our approach on and 
the metrics we'll be using to evaluate our approach.
