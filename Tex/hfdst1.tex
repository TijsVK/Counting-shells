\chapter{Introduction}

Once per year, nearly a thousand volunteers travel to the Belgian coast to collect and categorize the shells that wash up on the beach. This data is collected by the Flemish Institute For The Sea (VLIZ) to study populations of marine mollusks and the impact of their environment (climate change, fishing, etc) on the population. The volunteers participating in this study are mostly enthusiasts, but also scientists and families with children. To ensure a good quality of the data, most volunteers participate in a workshop prior to the activity. The counting of the shells is done by walking along the beach and log every individual shell that is found. This is a very time-consuming process, and the volunteers are often not very experienced in counting, resulting in mistakes with all but the most common shells. When a volunteer finds a shell that they are not familiar with, they can contact a helpdesk to help them. The flowchart of the current process can be found in figure \ref{fig:1_current_scenario}.

The fact that the project relies on volunteers to do most of the legwork, combined with experts having to man the checkpoints and the helpdesk, makes the project unscalable beyond having a single dedicated day each year. With over 5 million people

visiting the Belgian coast every year\cite{Kustportaal}, there is a lot of potential data to collect if the process of collecting the data could be simplified and accessible to anyone visiting the beach at any time.

In this thesis, we will attempt to simplify the process of data collection so that it can be done by anyone, anywhere, at any time. We will do this by training a counting network so that shells can be recognized in an image and counted automatically. This is already done on a smaller scale by VLIZ with Obsidentify, a mobile app and website where users can submit pictures of a single shell and get a result of what kind of shell it is. This is a useful tool, but taking a close-up picture of every single shell is again a very time-consuming process. 

As no dataset exists with large quantities of annotated pictures of beaches, we will have to work with a dataset of limited size to train the neural network. After the successful completion of this thesis, the new ideal scenario for collecting data can be found in figure \ref{fig:1_ideal_scenario}. Compared to the current process, found in figure \ref{fig:1_current_scenario}, this new process nearly eliminates the experts' involvement and thus makes the process scalable.

We will be studying if current counting networks are performant enough to recognize shells in beach images. We will build up to this by first training a network to count objects from a more established dataset in order to have a baseline to compare our model to. Afterward, we will then train that network with a small dataset to count shells and study its performance.

In the remainder of this thesis, we will first discuss the state of the art in the field of object detection and counting, with a focus on few-shot learning. We will then discuss the datasets and the network architecture that we will be using. In the second semester, we will implement the network and train it on the datasets. We will then discuss the results and the limitations of our model. Finally, we will discuss future work that can be done to improve the model.
