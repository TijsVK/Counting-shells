  abstract       = {The crowd counting task has become a pillar for crowd control as it provides information concerning the number of people in a scene. It is helpful in many scenarios such as video surveillance, public safety, and future event planning. To solve such tasks, researchers have proposed different solutions. In the beginning, researchers went with more traditional solutions, while recently the focus is on deep learning methods and, more specifically, on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), because of their efficiency. This review explores these methods by focusing on their key differences, advantages, and disadvantages. We have systematically analyzed algorithms and works based on the different models suggested and the problems they are trying to solve. The main focus is on the shift made in the history of crowd counting methods, moving from the heuristic models to CNN models by identifying each category and discussing its different methods and architectures. After a deep study of the literature on crowd counting, the survey partitions current datasets into sparse and crowded ones. It discusses the reviewed methods by comparing their results on the different datasets. The findings suggest that the heuristic models could be even more effective than the CNN models in sparse scenarios.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, text categorization has been studied as the problem of training of a classifier using labeled data. However, people can categorize documents into named categories without any explicit training because we know the meaning of category names. In this paper, we introduce Dataless Classification, a learning protocol that uses world knowledge to induce classifiers without the need for any labeled data. Like humans, a dataless classifier interprets a string of words as a set of semantic concepts. We propose a model for dataless classification and show that the label name alone is often sufficient to induce classifiers. Using Wikipedia as our source of world knowledge, we get 85.29% accuracy on tasks from the 20 Newsgroup dataset and 88.62% accuracy on tasks from a Yahoo! Answers dataset without any labeled or unlabeled data from the datasets. With unlabeled data, we can further improve the results and show quite competitive performance to a supervised learning algorithm that uses 100 labeled examples.}

  abstract  = {The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric components. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons, can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensional image. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory.}

  abstract  = {Detecting rare objects from a few examples is an emerging problem. Prior works show meta-learning is a promising approach. But, fine-tuning techniques have drawn scant attention. We find that fine-tuning only the last layer of existing detectors on rare classes is crucial to the few-shot object detection task. Such a simple approach outperforms the meta-learning methods by roughly 2&nbsp;20 points on current benchmarks and sometimes even doubles the accuracy of the prior methods. However, the high variance in the few samples often leads to the unreliability of existing benchmarks. We revise the evaluation protocols by sampling multiple groups of training examples to obtain stable comparisons and build new benchmarks based on three datasets: PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS. Again, our fine-tuning approach establishes a new state of the art on the revised benchmarks. The code as well as the pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ucbdrive/few-shot-object-detection.}

  abstract = {Few-shot learning is proposed to overcome the problem of scarce training data in novel classes. Recently, few-shot learning has been well adopted in various computer vision tasks such as object recognition and object detection. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have less attention to effectively reuse the information from previous stages. In this paper, we propose a new framework of few-shot learning for object detection. In particular, we adopt Baby Learning mechanism along with the multiple receptive fields to effectively utilize the former knowledge in novel domain. The propoed framework imitates the learning process of a baby through visual cues. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the SOTA methods on the benchmarks (improve average 7.0% on PASCAL VOC and 1.6% on MS COCO).}

  abstract       = {Recently, few-shot object detection based on fine-tuning has attracted much attention in the field of computer vision. However, due to the scarcity of samples in novel categories, obtaining positive anchors for novel categories is difficult, which implicitly introduces the foreground&ndash;background imbalance problem. It is difficult to identify foreground objects from complex backgrounds due to various object sizes and cluttered backgrounds. In this article, we propose a novel context information refinement few-shot detector (CIR-FSD) for remote sensing images. In particular, we design a context information refinement (CIR) module to extract discriminant context features. This module uses dilated convolutions and dense connections to capture rich context information from different receptive fields and then uses a binary map as the supervision label to refine the context information. In addition, we improve the region proposal network (RPN). Concretely, the RPN is fine-tuned on novel categories, and the constraint of non-maximum suppression (NMS) is relaxed, which can obtain more positive anchors for novel categories. Experiments on two remote sensing public datasets show the effectiveness of our detector.},
