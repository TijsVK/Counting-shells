In this thesis, we will explore the field of few-shot object detection to find out if recent advancements have made it performant enough to be able to detect and count shells on a beach.

Few-shot object detection is a newer field of research in computer vision that has been gaining traction in the last few years. 
As opposed to the related field of image classification, where the goal is to classify an image into one of a few classes, object detection aims to detect objects from a few classes in an image. This is a more difficult task, as the network has to not only classify the image but also localize the objects in the image. The added restriction of few-shot, not having a lot of images of the objects we want to detect to work with, makes it so that we do not have sufficient information on the objects to detect them. The only way to achieve reliable detection is to make up for the gap in our knowledge in a different way. This is where the field of few-shot object detection comes in. It allows us to first gain generic knowledge by learning from a large dataset and then fine-tuning that knowledge to our specific task by learning from a small dataset.
