\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter we will discuss the implementation of the network. We will first discuss the dataset and network architecture we will be using. We will then go into detail about the implementation of the network and the training process. 

\section{Dataset}
We will first use a dataset for object detection and counting to establish a baseline for our model. We will then use a small dataset of shells to train our model to count shells.
